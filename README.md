# Bus Times Pebble

Bus Times Pebble displays upcoming departure times for nearby bus stops on your Pebble watch.
Details can be found on the [Bus Times Server repository](https://github.com/keanulee/bus-times-server).

## Requirements

This app requires [httpebble](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/httpebble/id650174711?mt=8) or
[Pebble Connect with httpebble]('https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble)
to be installed on the paired mobile device. This is needed for the app to access location information and
the network.

## Controls
